<A_SN> I should make a game out of my ARSS by using spectrograms as elevation maps, then you could actually ride the music lol
<jtg> I'm thinking of coding something similar .. at the moment it's just going to be in 2d and generated randomly, but if it goes well it might be 3d by the end of the summer hols
<jtg> A_SN: know any good beat detection algorythms, btw? google doesn't seem to be any good
<A_SN> nope, but I could think up some :)

<A_SN> jtg : if I was you I'd go with a simple envelope detection algorithm and the do a differential on it to find the quick changes (attacks)
<A_SN> *and then
<donskeeto> depending on the musical style and the production itself, peak detection is enough.
<A_SN> oh, how so?
<donskeeto> if you take some techno crap song, you just check for peaks and you have the beat.

<A_SN> if you high pass filter for hi hats first I think you might got a good result, by detecting the minimum space between two hits
<A_SN> *get
<donskeeto> does not necessarily help if the hi hats don't play "an even" beat.
<donskeeto> all depending on the musical style though.
<A_SN> even? not sure what you mean by that
<donskeeto> shuffle for example
<donskeeto> or like, x--x--x-x-

<donskeeto> instead of x-x-x-x
<A_SN> yeah well like I said it doesn't matter if you look for the minimum space
<A_SN> or the lowest common denominator between hit spacings
<A_SN> I mean highest comment denominator.. I guess..
<A_SN> *common
<jtg> either would probably work in a way
<jtg> I mean, anyway, if the bpm you get is too fast you'll probably want to halve it anyway to make something playable
* MaD-r has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
<jtg> I suppose there's two problems in a way, finding a bpm for the song and finding individual beats - for beats it doesn't really matter if you get some irregular ones, since if you follow those it'll fit the music anyway. for a bpm you need a better method though .. finding the hcf or something would work
<A_SN> why do you want a beat detector by the way?
<jtg> I'm thinking of coding something like audiosurf over the holidays .. it'll just be 2d and randomly generated for now, but if I have time, it'd be cool to have the whole "based on your music" thing
<A_SN> sounds boring honestly
<A_SN> instead of making a game to surf your music, make a game where surfing makes music ;)
<slash_> anyone here ever used the sdl-bindings in the lispbuilder-package?
<A_SN> no
