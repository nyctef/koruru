jtg> If you've got a setup like bejewlled, what's a good way to detect groups of three etc?

<jtg> hey Alam_Debi 
<jtg> *Alvin
<Alvin^> I am so that guy
<jtg> heh
<Dr_Ian> what the shit is bejewelleled
* mithAFK (~mithris@ua-83-227-219-197.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se) has joined #gp2xdev
* empee gives channel operator status to mithAFK
<Dr_Ian> ok I see
<Alvin^> jtg: linked lists of some kind?
<Dr_Ian> record which counters have changed
<jtg> exam leave has started, so I've been pretty much coding all day. Now my head is funny X/
<Dr_Ian> and when you check for groups, only check groups which involve those

<Dr_Ian> OR: Brute force the shit out of it
<jtg> Dr_Ian: that's a good idea
<jtg> thanks
<Dr_Ian> I hope you mean the first idea
<Alvin^> he doesn't
<jtg> yeah :)

<Orkie> fill vertically and fill horizontally
<jtg> to wikipedia!
<jtg> looks good, thanks :)
<Orkie> it's what i do for burokku, but i let it fill in any direction :)
<Dr_Ian> how do the groups attach
<Dr_Ian> 3 or more in a row?
<Orkie> Dr_Ian: yes
<Dr_Ian> for jtg
<jtg> nah, you can have a corner shape aswell, but not diagonals (only filling in four directions)
<Orkie> you can? :S
<Orkie> i've only ever played bejewled once :D
<jtg> Orkie: it's not going to be bejewled exactly, but it's the same problem
<Orkie> still, v/h flood fill will do it
<joyrider> flood fill is what i did as well, you just keep calling the same function with the X & Y values changed
<jtg> I'm thinking of doing something like audiosurf over the summer - it's just 2d for now and there isn't any music stuff but the basics seem fairly easy, then it'll be 3d if I get time :)
<Orkie> joyrider: yep, and you can make it count by adding the return value from one call to a variable and returning that
<joyrider> yup
<Dr_Ian> oh
<joyrider> although i returned a score :)
<Dr_Ian> you could do that, but it would be a rather ugly solution
<Orkie> Dr_Ian: there are other flood fills
<Dr_Ian> I'm sure in this case it is somewhat trivial to calculate the largest possible group size
<Orkie> but for a small board, you never really going to have a stack overflow
<Dr_Ian> yes exactly
<Orkie> and this is the easiest flood fill
<Dr_Ian> probably not
<Orkie> yes, it is. i've looked into it a lot for burokku
<Orkie> which is the same as jtg's pattern ;)
<Dr_Ian> isn't burokku similar to yoshi's jigface
<Orkie> jigface? :S
<joyrider> hmm you swap columns right ? in that yoshi game
<joyrider> at least that's what i remember from the gameboy
<Dr_Ian> yeah, so you'd only need to do a horizontal check and a vertical check. flood fill would be way excessive.
<Orkie> Dr_Ian: if he wants branches coming off the middle, he does
<Orkie> (need some kind of flood fill)
<Dr_Ian> oh, yeah
<Dr_Ian> but a recursive one with no backsight is a bit ugly
<Dr_Ian> I mean slightly wasteful and not so pretty in code
