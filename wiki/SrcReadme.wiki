 = Conventions = 

 == Class Names ==  
 
  Class names are in camel case and have an intial letter that denotes their type:
    
    * i - interface
    * c - normal class
    * m - mixin
  
    
 == Names == 
  
  Object methods and variables should be_lowercase_with_underscores. Functions that return a bool
  should probably be named as a question -- can_open_doors(), or has_no_fear(), for example.
  
  
 == Braces and Indentation == 
  
  Braces are arranged as in a rough k&r style - code appearance/readability should always
  take preference over any particular style. Indentation should be used liberally - for example, 
  between glBegin and glEnd, or gl[Push/Pop]Matrix as well as conditionals, loops, functions and 
  classes.
